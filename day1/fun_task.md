# Python Day 1 - Tiny Fun Task

## Mission: Save the Ice Cream Shop!

**Story:**  
You are the new owner of a tiny cute **Ice Cream Shop**.  
Customers are coming, but you need a little program to handle them smartly!

Your task is to **build a tiny system** that does the following:

---

### Step-by-Step Adventure:

1. **Welcome the Customer:**  
   Print a warm greeting like:  
   `"Welcome to Magic Scoops Ice Cream Shop!"`

2. **Ask Their Name and Age:**  
   Use `input()` to ask for:  
   - Their **name** (string).  
   - Their **age** (number).

3. **Offer Based on Age:**  
   - If the age is **less than 12**: Offer a **"Kids Special"** ice cream with a 50% discount.  
   - If the age is between **12 and 60**: Offer the **"Regular Delights"** menu.  
   - If the age is **above 60**: Offer a **"Golden Age Treat"** with a free topping.

4. **Give a Tiny Gift:**  
   - Using a **loop**, print a `"Thank you, [name]!"` message **3 times** (because happy customers come back!).

5. **Bonus Curiosity Twist:**  
   - If their name starts with the letter **"A"** or **"a"**, print: `"You get a free magical sprinkle!"`  
   - (Hint: Use string methods like `.startswith()` or indexing.)

---

### Special Rule:
If the entered **age is 0 or negative**,  
- Print: `"Oops! That's not a valid age. Please try again later."`  
- Then **end** the program politely.

- Use if-else conditions to decide the menu.
- Use for or while loop to print multiple thank-you messages.
- Explore strings: Check the first letter of a name.
- Handle invalid input smartly.

## Final Touch:
Imagine you're designing this for real kids and families coming to your shop â€” make it fun, colorful, and polite!

No need to rush. Take your time, build it step-by-step, and smile after each win!
